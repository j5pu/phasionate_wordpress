My plugin will list any role registered in the traditional WordPress way. If your membership plugin is using some other system, then Nav Menu Roles won't work with it out of the box.  Since 1.3.5 I've added a filter called <code>nav_menu_roles_item_visibility</code> just before my code decides whether to show/hide a menu item. There's also always been the <code>nav_menu_roles</code> filter which lets you modify the roles listed in the admin. Between these two, I believe you have enough to integrate Nav Menu Roles with any membership plugin."

The second function is pretty generic and won't actually do anything because you need to supply your own logic based on the plugin you are using.  Nav Menu Roles will save the new \"role\" info and add it to the item in an array to the <code>$item-&gt;roles</code> variable."
